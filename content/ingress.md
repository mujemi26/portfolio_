🚀  The Modern Guide to Ingress in Kubernetes  
How traffic really enters your cluster, what breaks without it, and how to fix it fast.

---

🔍  What is Ingress (and why should I care)?

*Ingress* is a Kubernetes object that **manages external access** to Services inside your cluster, typically HTTP(S).  
Think of it as a **Layer-7 router** that lives inside your cluster:

- Reads the Host header & URL path  
- Routes traffic to the right Service/Port  
- Optionally terminates TLS, rewrites URLs, adds headers, etc.

Without Ingress you have only **Services of type LoadBalancer or NodePort**, which are **layer-4** (TCP/UDP). That means:

- One external IP per Service → 💸 cloud provider charges sky-rocket  
- No path-based routing → `example.com/app1` and `example.com/app2` must be separate Services  
- No TLS termination → you roll your own certificates  
- No canary, blue/green, or A/B traffic splitting  
- No WAF, rate-limiting, or global rules in one place  

In short, **Ingress gives you a single, smart front door** for every workload in the cluster. 🚪✨

⚠️  Top Pain Points BEFORE you adopt Ingress

| Problem | Symptom | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **IP sprawl** | 50 Services = 50 cloud load-balancers | \$100–\$300 / month each |
| **DNS hell** | Every Service needs its own DNS entry | Ops burnout |
| **No path routing** | `example.com:30001`, `example.com:30002` | Users hate you |
| **DIY TLS** | Secrets mounted by hand or cert-manager chaos | Expiry outages |
| **Zero observability** | Logs/metrics only at Service level | Hard to debug 502s |

🎉  Life AFTER Ingress (NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy, AWS ALB, GKE, Istio Gateway, etc.)

| Benefit | How it helps |
|---|---|
| **Single IP / DNS** | One `A` record for `*.example.com` |
| **Path & host routing** | `example.com/api → api-svc`, `example.com/web → web-svc` |
| **Automatic TLS** | cert-manager + Let’s Encrypt = 🔐 auto-renewal |
| **Global rate-limits** | One ConfigMap, all workloads protected |
| **Canary / A/B** | Ingress-NGINX `canary-weight: 20` |
| **Cost savings** | 1 cloud LB instead of 50 → \$10,000+/yr saved |

🛠️  Quick-Start YAML (NGINX example)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts: [demo.example.com]
    secretName: demo-tls
  rules:
  - host: demo.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-svc
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-svc
            port:
              number: 80
```

Apply with `kubectl apply -f demo-ingress.yaml`, point DNS at the Ingress controller’s external IP, and you’re live. 🎊

🔎  Troubleshooting Playbook (the 80 % fixes)

| Symptom | Likely Cause | One-liner Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **404 from Ingress** | Wrong path/host | `kubectl get ing -o yaml` → check `rules` |
| **Certificate stuck** | cert-manager can’t solve ACME | `kubectl describe cert demo-tls` → fix DNS-01 or HTTP-01 |
| **502 Bad Gateway** | Service selector mismatch | `kubectl get endpoints api-svc` → should list Pods |
| **Infinite redirect (http→https)** | `ssl-redirect: "true"` loop | Add `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"` for health checks |
| **502 after scaling** | Pod readinessProbe fails | `kubectl describe pod` → fix readiness or startupProbe |
| **High 5xx rate** | Upstream timeout | `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "120"` |
| **Wrong IngressClass** | Multiple controllers | Set `spec.ingressClassName` or annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` |
| **CORS blocked** | Browser preflight fails | Add `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "*"` |

Pro-tip: `kubectl plugin view-utilization` + `k9s` or `Lens` gives you real-time metrics and logs.

🧪  Advanced Patterns (once you’re comfortable)

- **Multiple controllers**: public vs. private, or split by team namespaces  
- **Istio Gateway + Ingress**: use Ingress for edge TLS, Istio for mesh routing  
- **External-DNS**: auto-create DNS records from Ingress resources  
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: policy to block Ingresses without TLS or correct labels  
- **Blue/Green via Argo Rollouts**: `canary: stableService, canaryService`

📝  TL;DR Cheat-Sheet

1. No Ingress → many IPs, no L7, DIY TLS → pain.  
2. Add Ingress controller + Ingress objects → one IP, L7 routing, auto-TLS → 💰 saved.  
3. 90 % of outages are: wrong Service selector, missing DNS, cert issuer broken.  
4. Use `kubectl describe`, logs, and metrics; fix annotations → problem solved.  

Happy routing!
